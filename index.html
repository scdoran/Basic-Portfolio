					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<img id="bio-image" src="assets/images/my picture.jpg" alt="My Picture">
					<p>My name is Sarah Doran. I am an elementary school technology teacher who dreams of becoming a code wizard.  I have taught for three years, but have been in schools for almost five years. Although the teaching scene has been good to me, I strive to do something more creative and challenging for my future career.</p>

					<p>When I am not teaching I am cooking and experimenting with vegetarian meals, visiting local breweries, collecting pins, patches and artwork, and watching "B" horror movies.</p>
